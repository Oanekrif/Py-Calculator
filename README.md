# 🧮 Simple Calculator using Python (Tkinter)</br></br></br>


 ## 📋 Project Description:
This project is a simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it a great learning tool for Python beginners.</br>

## 🛠️ Key Features:
• GUI Interface: Built with Tkinter for a clean and user-friendly design.</br>
• Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</br>
• Clear Function: Easily reset the calculator input field.</br>
• Responsive Layout: Buttons are arranged in a grid for easy navigation.</br>

## 🌐 Technologies Used:
• Python 3.x</br>
• Tkinter (Python's built-in GUI library)</br>

## 🚀 **How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oanekrif/Py-Calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Py-Calculator
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
</br>

## 📝 Code Highlights:
• Input Handling: The calculator updates the display dynamically based on user input.</br>
• Evaluation Function: Uses Python's eval() function to compute the result.</br>
• Error Handling: Prevents invalid operations (like division by zero) with simple checks.</br>

## 📸 Screenshots:
Include screenshots of the calculator interface, showing operations and results.</br>

## 🎯 Future Enhancements:
• Add support for advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).</br>
• Implement error messages for invalid inputs.</br>
• Improve the design with custom styles or themes.</br>
